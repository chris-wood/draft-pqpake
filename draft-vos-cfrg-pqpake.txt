                      draft-vos-cfrg-pqpake-latest

Abstract

   This document describes the CPaceQUAKE+ protocol, a hybrid asymmetric
   password-authenticated key exchange (aPAKE) that supports mutual
   authentication in a client-server setting secure against quantum-
   capable attackers.  CPaceQUAKE+ is the result of a KEM-based
   transformation from the hybrid symmetric PAKE protocol called
   CPaceQUAKE that is also described in this document.  This document
   recommends configurations for CPaceQUAKE+ and corresponding test
   vectors.

1.  Introduction

   Asymmetric (or Augmented) Password Authenticated Key Exchange (aPAKE)
   protocols are designed to provide password authentication and
   mutually authenticated key exchange in a client-server setting
   without relying on a public key infrastructure (PKI) and without
   disclosing passwords to servers or other entities other than the
   client machine.  The only stage where PKI is required is during a
   client's registration.

   In the asymmetric PAKE setting, the client first registers a password
   verifier with the server.  A verifier is a value that is derived from
   the password and which the client will later use to demonstrate
   knowledge of the password.  After registration, the client uses its
   password and the server uses the corresponding verifier to establish
   an authenticated shared secret such that the server learns nothing of
   the client's password.

   OPAQUE-3DH [OPAQUE] and SPAKE2+ [SPAKE2PLUS] are two examples of
   specified aPAKE protocols.  These protocols provide security in
   classical threat models.  However, in the presence of a quantum-
   capable attacker, both OPAQUE and SPAKE2+ fail to provide the desired
   level of security.  Both protocols are vulnerable to a Harvest Now,
   Decrypt Later attack executed by a quantum-capable attacker, in which
   the attacker learns the shared secret and uses it to compromise
   application traffic.  Upgrading both protocols to provide post-
   quantum security is non-trivial, especially as there are no known
   efficient constructions for certain building blocks used in these
   protocols (such as the OPRF used in OPAQUE-3DH).  As the threat of
   quantum-capable attackers looms, the viability of existing aPAKE
   protocols in practice diminishes in time.

   This document describes the CPaceQUAKE+ protocol, an aPAKE that
   supports mutual authentication in a client-server setting secure
   against quantum-capable attackers.  CPaceQUAKE+ is the result of a
   KEM-based transformation from the hybrid symmetric PAKE protocol
   called CPaceQUAKE.

   This document fully specifies CPaceQUAKE+ and all dependencies
   necessary to implement it.  Section 7 provides recommended
   configurations.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.1.  Notation and Terminology

   The following functions and operators are used throughout the
   document.

   *  The function random(n) generates a cryptographically secure
      pseudorandom byte string of length n bytes.

   *  The associative binary operator || denotes concatenation of two
      byte strings.

   *  The binary function XOR(a, b) denotes an element-wise XOR
      operation between two byte strings a and b of the same length.

   *  The functions bytes_to_int and int_to_bytes convert byte strings
      to and from non-negative integers. bytes_to_int and int_to_bytes
      are implemented as OS2IP and I2OSP as described in [RFC8017],
      respectively.

   All algorithms and procedures described in this document are laid out
   in a Python-like pseudocode.  Each function takes a set of inputs and
   parameters and produces a set of output values.  We denote optional
   inputs between square brackets: e.g. [optional input].  Parameters
   become constant values once the protocol variant and the
   configuration are fixed.

3.  Overview

   This document aims to specify two protocols: a symmetric and an
   asymmetric hybrid PAKE.  In the symmetric PAKE setting, the client
   and server share a password and use it to establish an authenticated
   shared secret.  In the asymmetric PAKE setting, the client first
   registers a password verifier with the server.  A verifier is a value
   that is derived from the password and which the client will later use
   to demonstrate knowledge of the password.  After registration, the
   client uses its password and the server uses the corresponding
   verifier to establish an authenticated shared secret such that the
   server learns nothing of the client's password.

   The aPAKE specified in this document is composed of multiple smaller
   protocols, including the hybrid symmetric PAKE protocol called
   CPaceQUAKE.  CPaceQUAKE is in turn a composition of two other PAKE
   protocols: the existing CPace [CPACE] and a new post-quantum PAKE
   called QUAKE.  To achieve the asymmetric property, the aPAKE also
   builds upon a password confirmation sub-protocol as specified in
   Section 6.2.

   We refer to the fully composed aPAKE as CPaceQUAKE+. An abstract
   overview of the composition of this protocol is shown in the figure
   below.  In the subsequent sections we break down the sub-protocols
   into even smaller building blocks.

               +--------------------+

   We note that this standard only specifies the composition of CPace
   and QUAKE.  It is not necessarily true that one can securely compose
   all PAKEs this way.

   The rest of this document specifies CPaceQUAKE+ and its dependencies.
   Section 5 specifies the CPaceQUAKE protocol, and Section 6 specifies
   the CPaceQUAKE+ protocol, incorporating the former protocol.  Each of
   these pieces build upon the cryptographic dependencies specified in
   Section 4.

4.  Cryptographic Dependencies

   The protocols in this document have four primary dependencies:

   *  Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM); Section 4.1

   *  Binary Uniform Key Encapsulation Mechanism (BUKEM); Section 4.2

   *  Key Derivation Function (KDF); Section 4.3

   *  Key Stretching Function (KSF); Section 4.4

   Section 7 specifies different combinations of each of these
   dependencies that are suitable for implementation.

4.1.  Key Encapsulation Mechanism

   A Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) is an algorithm that is used for
   exchanging a secret from one party to another.  We require a KEM with
   key derivation from a seed.  It consists of the following syntax.

   *  DeriveKeyPair(seed): Deterministic algorithm to derive a key pair
      (sk, pk) from the byte string seed, where seed SHOULD have Nseed
      bytes.

   *  Encaps(pk): Randomized algorithm to generate an ephemeral, fixed-
      length symmetric key (the KEM shared secret) and a fixed-length
      encapsulation of that key that can be decapsulated by the holder
      of the secret key corresponding to pk.  This function can raise an
      EncapsError on encapsulation failure.

   *  Decaps(ct, skR): Deterministic algorithm using the secret key sk
      to recover the ephemeral symmetric key (the KEM shared secret)
      from its encapsulated representation ct.  This function can raise
      a DecapsError on decapsulation failure.

   *  Nseed: The length in bytes of the seed used to derive a key pair.

   *  Nsecret: The length in bytes of a shared secret produced by this
      KEM.

   *  Nct: The length in bytes of an encapsulated key produced by this
      KEM.

   *  Npk: The length in bytes of a public key for this KEM.

   *  Nsk: The length in bytes of a secret key for this KEM.

   This specification uses X-Wing [XWING].

4.2.  Binary Uniform KEM

   A binary uniform KEM supports the same functions as defined above for
   a KEM, except that it also achieves stronger notions of security.
   Specifically, public keys and ciphertexts are indistinguishable from
   random strings of bytes (of the same length).  This is crucial for
   the security of QUAKE.  In other words, one MUST NOT use a KEM that
   is not uniform in place of a uniform KEM.

   This specification uses a variant of ML-KEM768 [FIPS203-Draft],
   denoted ML-BUKEM768.  This is instantiated with Kemeleon [KEMELEON].

4.3.  Key Derivation Function

   A Key Derivation Function (KDF) is a function that takes some source
   of initial keying material and uses it to derive one or more
   cryptographically strong keys.  This specification uses a KDF with
   the following API and parameters:

   *  Extract(salt, ikm): Extract a pseudorandom key of fixed length Nx
      bytes from input keying material ikm and an optional byte string
      salt.

   *  Expand(prk, info, L): Expand a pseudorandom key prk using the
      optional string info into L bytes of output keying material.

   *  Nx: The output size of the Extract() function in bytes.

4.4.  Key Stretching Function

   This specification makes use of a Key Stretching Function (KSF),
   which is a slow and expensive cryptographic hash function with the
   following API:

   *  Stretch(msg, salt, L): Apply a key stretching function to stretch
      the input msg and salt salt, hardening it against offline
      dictionary attacks.  This function also needs to satisfy collision
      resistance.  The output is a string of L bytes.

5.  CPaceQUAKE Protocol

   The hybrid, symmetric PAKE protocol, denoted CPaceQUAKE consists of
   CPace [CPace] combined with QUAKE [QUAKE].  At a high level,
   CPaceQUAKE is a two-round protocol that runs between client and
   server wherein, upon completion, both parties share the same session
   key if they agree on the password-related string (PRS).  Otherwise,
   they obtain random session keys.  This is summarized in the diagram
   below.

               +----------------------------------------+
               | CPaceQUAKE   +----------+              |
               |              |  CPace   |              |
   Client's    |              | protocol |              |    Server's
   password -->|              +----------+              |<-- password
               |                                        |
               |              +----------+              |
               |              |  QUAKE   |              |
   Session <---+              | protocol |              +--> Session
     key       |              +----------+              |      key
               +----------------------------------------+

   CPaceQUAKE composes CPace and QUAKE by first running CPace between
   client and server, and then incorporating the CPace session key into
   the password before running QUAKE between the server and client.  We
   explain the composition in more detail in Section 5.3.

5.1.  CPace Specification

   CPace is a classical elliptic curve-based PAKE [CPACE].  This section
   wraps the CPace specification in a consistent interface.  We use an
   interactive version of CPace that takes two rounds, in which there is
   a designated initiator and responder.  In other words, the responder
   only starts executing the protocol after it received the first
   message from the initiator.

   The flow of the protocol consists of three messages sent between
   initiator and responder, produced by the functions Init, Respond, and
   Finish, described below.  Both parties take as input a password-
   related string PRS, an optional unique shared session identifier sid,
   and an optional client identifier U and server identifier S (e.g., a
   device identifier, an IP address, or URL pertaining to the client and
   server).  Upon completion, both parties obtain matching session keys
   if their PRS, sid, key length (specified by N), and client and server
   identifiers match.  Otherwise, they obtain random keys.  In
   exceptional cases, the protocol aborts.

5.1.1.  Initiation

   The initiator starts the protocol using its password-related string
   PRS.  Additionally, it may bind the session to an existing shared
   session identifier sid.  CPace also allows to bind the session to an
   existing channel identifier.  To remain consistent with the other
   PAKEs in this specification, the channel identifier is the
   concatenation of optional client and server identifiers.

CPace.Init

Input:
- PRS, password-related string, a byte string
- sid, session identifier, a byte string
- U and S, client and server identifiers

Output:
- ya, discrete logarithm intended to be stored in secret until the protocol finishes
- Ya, public point, intended to be sent to the responder

Parameters:
- G, a group environment as specified in CPace

def Init(PRS, sid, U, S):
  g = G.calculate_generator(H, PRS, U || S, sid)
  ya = G.sample_scalar()
  Ya = G.scalar_mult(ya, g)
  return ya, Ya

5.1.2.  Response

   The responder performs the same actions as the initiator.  Since it
   already received the initiator's message, it can immediately finish
   its execution of the protocol.  It outputs the shared secret and a
   message Yb intended to be sent to the initiator.

  CPace.Respond

  Input:
  - PRS, password-related string, a byte string
  - Ya, public point, received from the initiator
  - sid, session identifier, a byte string
  - U and S, client and server identifiers

  Output:
  - ISK, the established shared secret
  - Yb, public point, intended to be sent to the initiator

  Parameters:
  - G, a group environment as specified in CPace
  - H, a hash function as specified in CPace

  Exceptions:
  - CPaceError, raised when an invalid value was encountered in CPace

  def Respond(PRS, Ya, sid, U, S):
    g = G.calculate_generator(H, PRS, U || S, sid)
    yb = G.sample_scalar()
    Yb = G.scalar_mult(yb, g)

    K = G.scalar_mult_vfy(yb, Ya)
    If K = G.I, raise CPaceError

    ISK = H.hash(lv_cat(G.DSI || b"_ISK", sid, K) || transcript(Ya, Yb))

    return ISK, Yb

5.1.3.  Finish

   The initiator finishes the protocol by combining the discrete
   logarithm ya generated by CPace.Init and the message Yb received from
   the responder.

  CPace.Finish

  Input:
  - PRS, password-related string, a byte string
  - ya, discrete logarithm that was generated using CPace.Init
  - Yb, public point, received from the responder
  - sid, session identifier, a byte string
  - U and S, client and server identifiers

  Output:
  - ISK, the established shared secret

  Parameters:
  - G, a group environment as specified in CPace
  - H, a hash function as specified in CPace

  Exceptions:
  - CPaceError, raised when an invalid value was encountered in CPace

  def Finish(PRS, ya, Yb, sid):
    K = G.scalar_mult_vfy(yb, Ya)
    If K = G.I, raise CPaceError

    ISK = H.hash(lv_cat(G.DSI || b"_ISK", sid, K) || transcript(Ya, Yb))

    return ISK

5.2.  QUAKE Specification

   QUAKE is a PAKE built on a BUKEM and KDF.  If the BUKEM provides
   security against quantum-enabled attacks, then so does QUAKE.  It
   consists of three messages sent between initiator and responder,
   produced by the functions Init, Respond, and Finish, described below.
   Both parties take as input a password-related string PRS, a required
   unique shared session identifier sid, and an optional client
   identifier U and server identifier S.  Upon completion, both parties
   obtain matching session keys if their PRS, sid, key length (specified
   by N), and client and server identifiers match.  Otherwise, they
   obtain random session keys.

   The shared session identifier has the following requirements.  If a
   client and server identifier are provided:

   *  The session identifier must match between the client and server

   *  This session identifier has not been used before in a session
      between the client and server

   If no client and server identifiers are provided:

   *  The session identifier must match between the client and server

   *  This session identifier has not been used before by the client or
      server in any session with any other party

   These requirements originate from the security proof for QUAKE.  If
   these requirements are not met, the proof does not apply, but this
   does not mean that the protocol becomes vulnerable.

5.2.1.  Initiation

   Init takes as input the initiator's PRS, session identifier sid, and
   optional client and server identifiers U and S.  It produces a
   context for the initiator to store, as well as a protocol message
   that is sent to the responder.  Its implementation is as follows.

QUAKE.Init

Input:
- PRS, password-related string, a byte string
- sid, session identifier, a byte string
- U and S, client and server identifiers

Output:
- context, opaque state for the initiator to store
- msg, an encoded protocol message for the initiator to send to the responder

Parameters:
- BUKEM, a BUKEM instance
- KDF, a KDF instance
- DST, domain separation tag, a byte string

def Init(PRS, sid, U, S):
  seed = random(BUKEM.Nseed)
  (pk, sk) = BUKEM.DeriveKeyPair(seed)

  r = random(3 * Nsec)

  fullsid = encode_sid(sid, U, S)
  prk_r_pad = KDF.Extract(PRS, DST || "QUAKE" || fullsid)
  r_pad = KDF.Expand(prk_r_pad, DST || "r_pad", Npk)
  T = XOR(pk, r_pad)

  prk_s_pad = KDF.Extract(PRS, DST || "QUAKE" || T || fullsid)
  s_pad = KDF.Expand(prk_s_pad, DST || "s_pad", 3 * Nsec)
  s = XOR(r, s_pad)

  init_msg = s || T

  return Context(PRS, sk, s, T, fullsid), init_msg

   The encode_sid function is defined below.

   encode_sid

   Input:
   - sid, session identifier, a byte string
   - U and S, client and server identifiers

   Output:
   - fullsid, a byte string

   Parameters:
   - BUKEM, a BUKEM instance
   - KDF, a KDF instance

   def encode_sid(sid, U, U):
     fullsid =
       bytes_to_int(len(sid), 4) || sid ||
       bytes_to_int(len(U), 4) || U ||
       bytes_to_int(len(S), 4) || S
     return fullsid

5.2.2.  Response

   Respond takes as input the PRS, session identifier sid, the
   initiator's protocol message, and optional client and server
   identifiers.  It produces a 32-byte symmetric key and a protocol
   message intended to be sent to the initiator.  Its implementation is
   as follows.

   QUAKE.Respond

   Input:
   - PRS, password-related string, a byte string
   - init_msg, encoded protocol message, a byte string
   - sid, session identifier, a byte string
   - U and S, client and server identifiers

   Output:
   - ss, output shared secret, a byte string of 32 bytes
   - resp_msg, encoded protocol message, a byte string

   Parameters:
   - BUKEM, a BUKEM instance
   - KDF, a KDF instance
   - DST, domain separation tag, a byte string

   def Respond(PRS, init_msg, sid, U, S):
     (s, T) = init_msg[0..(3 * Nsec)], init_msg[(3 * Nsec)..]

     fullsid = encode_sid(sid, U, S)
     prk_s_pad = KDF.Extract(PRS, DST || "QUAKE" || T || fullsid)
     s_pad = KDF.Expand(prk_s_pad, DST || "s_pad", 3 * Nsec)
     r = XOR(s, s_pad)

     prk_r_pad = KDF.Extract(PRS, DST || "QUAKE" || fullsid)
     r_pad = KDF.Expand(prk_r_pad, DST || "r_pad", Npk)
     pk = XOR(T, r_pad)

     (ct, k) = BUKEM.Encaps(pk)
     resp_msg = ct

     prk_sk = KDF.Extract(k || PRS, DST || "QUAKE" || fullsid)
     key = KDF.Expand(prk_sk, DST || "sk", Nkey)

     return resp_msg, key

5.2.3.  Finish

   Finish takes as input the initiator-created context that is output
   from Init as well as the responder's reply message resp_msg.  It
   produces a symmetric key that is output to the initiator.  Its
   implementation is as follows.

   QUAKE.Finish

   Input:
   - context, opaque state for the initiator to store TODO
   - resp_msg, encoded protocol message, a byte string

   Output:
   - ss, output shared secret, a byte string of 32 bytes

   Parameters:
   - BUKEM, a BUKEM instance
   - KDF, a KDF instance
   - DST, domain separation tag, a byte string

   def Finish(context, resp_msg):
     (PRS, sk, s, T, fullsid) = context
     ct = resp_msg

     k = BUKEM.Decaps(sk, ct)

     prk_sk = KDF.Extract(k || PRS, DST || "QUAKE" || fullsid)
     key = KDF.Expand(prk_sk, DST || "sk", Nkey)

     return key

5.3.  Composition of CPace & QUAKE

   CPaceQUAKE is a sequential composition of CPace (see Section 5.1) and
   QUAKE (see Section 5.2).  Whereas running CPace and QUAKE in parallel
   realizes a worst-of-both worlds PAKE, this sequential composition
   realizes a best-of-both worlds PAKE.  In other words, CPaceQUAKE
   remains as secure as the strongest PAKE, resisting attacks that break
   the classical CPace (e.g. by a quantum-capable attacker) or attacks
   that break the quantum-resistant QUAKE (e.g. by a flaw in the BUKEM).
   This assumes that QUAKE is instantiated with a quantum-resistant
   BUKEM.

   To be precise, CPaceQUAKE first runs CPace using password-related
   string PRS, establishing a session key SK1 with the associated
   transcript tr1.  It then initiates QUAKE using the password-related
   string H(fullsid, PRS, tr1, SK1); a secret derived from the the
   original password-related string and the outputs from the CPace
   instance.  Here, fullsid is the output of encode_sid(sid, U, S).

   This is outlined in the diagram below.  In CPaceQUAKE, CPace is
   initiated by the first party, while QUAKE is initiated by the other
   party.  This results in a protocol that requires three messages.

            +----------------------------------------------------------------------+

            +----------------------------------------------------------------------+

   Unlike QUAKE, CPaceQUAKE does not require a shared session identifier
   sid, although this is strongly recommended.  If no sid is provided,
   CPace will run without an sid, and QUAKE will use a random string
   generated with random material provided by both parties.  If an sid
   is provided, both CPace and QUAKE will use this sid.

   An overview of the protocol flow is shown below.  The protocol has
   four functions.  Init and InitiatorFinish are intended to be called
   by the initiator, and Respond and ResponderFinish are intended to be
   called by the responder.  The following subsections specify these
   functions.

        output client_key              output server_key

5.3.1.  Client Initiation

   The client initiates a CPace exchange with the server using input
   PRS, an optional session identifier sid, and optional client and
   server identifiers U and S.  The output of this process is some
   context for completing the protocol and a protocol message.  The
   client sends this message to the server.

CPaceQUAKE.Init

Input:
- PRS, password-related string, a byte string
- sid, session identifier, a byte string
- U and S, client and server identifiers

Output:
- context, opaque state for the initiator to store
- msg, an encoded protocol message for the initiator to send to the responder

Parameters:
- CPace, parameterized instance of CPace

def Init(PRS, sid, U, S):
  ctx1, msg1 = CPace.Init(PRS, sid, U, S)

  if len(sid) == 0:
    s1 = random(32)

  return (ctx1, s1), (msg1, s1)

5.3.2.  Server Response

   The server processes the client message using its input PRS, an
   optional session identifier sid, and optional client and server
   identifiers U and S.  The first output of this function is a context
   that is used to finish the protocol later.  The second output is a
   protocol message intended for the client.

   The server responds to the CPace session that the client initiated,
   and it initiates a new QUAKE session using both the PRS and the key
   established by CPace.

   The server MUST ensure that exactly one of s1 and sid exists.  It
   MUST abort if the message does not have the correct length.

CPaceQUAKE.Respond

Input:
- PRS, password-related string, a byte string
- (msg1, s1), the message received from the client
- sid, session identifier, a byte string
- U and S, client and server identifiers

Output:
- context, opaque state for the responder to store
- msg, an encoded protocol message for the responder to send to the initiator

Parameters:
- CPace, parameterized instance of CPace
- QUAKE, parameterized instance of QUAKE
- DST, domain separation tag, a byte string

def Respond(PRS, (msg1, s1), sid, U, S):
  key1, msg2 = CPace.Respond(PRS, msg1, sid, U, S)

  if len(sid) == 0:
    s2 = random(32)
    sid_prk = KDF.Extract(s1 || s2, nil)
    sid = KDF.Expand(sid_prk, DST || "SID", 32)

  fullsid = encode_sid(sid, U, S)
  PRS2 = H(DST || fullsid || PRS || msg1 || msg2 || key1)
  ctx2, msg3 = QUAKE.Init(PRS2, sid, U, S)

  client_key = H(DST || fullsid || PRS || msg1 || msg2 || msg3 || msg4 || key1 || key2)

  return Context(fullsid, PRS, msg1, msg2, msg3, key1, ctx2), (msg2, msg3, s2)

5.3.3.  Client Finish

   The client finishes the protocol by processing the server response.
   The client obtains a shared secret and a final message intended for
   the server.  It does so by finishing the CPace session and responding
   to the QUAKE session.

   The client must ensure that exactly one of (s1, s2) and sid exists.
   The client should abort when the message does not have the correct
   length.

CPaceQUAKE.InitiatorFinish

Input:
- PRS, password-related string, a byte string
- (ctx1, s1), the context generated by CPaceQUAKE.Init
- (msg2, msg3, s2), the message received from the server
- sid, session identifier, a byte string
- U and S, client and server identifiers

Output:
- key, an N-byte shared secret
- msg, an encoded protocol message for the initiator to send to the responder

Parameters:
- CPace, parameterized instance of CPace
- QUAKE, parameterized instance of QUAKE
- DST, domain separation tag, a byte string

def InitiatorFinish(PRS, (ctx1, s1), (msg2, msg3, s2), sid, U, S):
  key1 = CPace.Finish(ctx1, msg2, sid, U, S)

  if sid does not exist:
    sid_prk = KDF.Extract(s1 || s2, DST)
    sid = KDF.Expand(sid_prk, DST || "SID", 32)

  fullsid = encode_sid(sid, U, S)
  PRS2 = H(DST || fullsid || PRS || msg1 || msg2 || key1)
  key2, msg4 = QUAKE.Respond(PRS2, sid, msg3, Nkey, U, S)

  client_key = H(DST || fullsid || PRS || msg1 || msg2 || msg3 || msg4 || key1 || key2)

  return client_key, msg4

5.3.4.  Server Finish

   The server finishes the protocol by finising QUAKE using the client's
   response, outputting a shared secret of N bytes.  It should abort
   when the message does not have the correct length.

CPaceQUAKE.ResponderFinish

Input:
- ctx, context from the server's Response
- msg4, the message received from the server, a byte string

Output:
- key, an N-byte shared secret

Parameters:
- QUAKE, parameterized instance of QUAKE
- DST, domain separation tag, a byte string

def ResponderFinish(ctx, msg4):
  (fullsid, PRS, msg1, msg2, msg3, key1, ctx2) = ctx

  key2 = QUAKE.Finish(ctx2, msg4)

  client_key = H(DST || fullsid || PRS || msg1 || msg2 || msg3 || msg4 || key1 || key2)

  return server_key

6.  CPaceQUAKE+ Protocol

   CPaceQUAKE+ is the 5 message aPAKE resulting from applying a KEM-
   based PAKE-to-aPAKE transformation to CPaceQUAKE.  At a high level,
   this involves running CPaceQUAKE on a verifier of the client's
   password.  To ensure that the client does indeed know the password
   pertaining to that verifier, there is an additional password
   confirmation stage that uses seed derived from the password.  Both
   the verifier and the seed are derived from the password using a key
   stretching function.  The seed is later used to derive a KEM public
   key.  We refer to the collection of the verifier and this public key
   as 'the verifiers'.

6.1.  Registering Clients

   This subsection specifies functions for generating the verifiers and
   a protocol for registering clients.

6.1.1.  Generating Verifiers

   Verifiers are random-looking value derived from password-related
   strings from which it is computionally impractical to derive the
   password-related string.  To make verifiers unique between different
   clients with the same password or servers that they interact with, we
   employ a salt and optional client and server identifiers.  The
   material required for the verifiers is generated as follows:

GenVerifierMaterial

Input:
- PRS, password-related string, a byte string
- salt, client-specific salt, a byte string
- U and S, client and server identifiers

Output:
- ss, output shared secret, a byte string of 32 bytes
- resp_msg, encoded protocol message, a byte string

Parameters:
- KSF, a parameterized KSF instance
- DST, domain separation tag, a byte string

def GenVerifierMaterial(PRS, salt, U, S):
  verifier_seed = KSF.Stretch(DST || PRS || U || S, salt, Nverifier + Nseed)
  verifier = verifier_seed[0:Nverifier]
  seed = verifier_seed[Nverifier:Nverifier + Nseed]
  return verifier, seed

   To derive an actual public key from the verifier material, we use the
   following function:

   GenVerifiers

   Input:
   - PRS, password-related string, a byte string
   - salt, client-specific salt, a byte string
   - U and S, client and server identifiers

   Output:
   - ss, output shared secret, a byte string of 32 bytes
   - resp_msg, encoded protocol message, a byte string

   Parameters:
   - KSF, a parameterized KSF instance

   def GenVerifiers(PRS, salt, U, S):
     verifier, seed = GenVerifierMaterial(PRS, salt, U, S)
     (pk, sk) = KEM.DeriveKeyPair(seed)
     return verifier, pk

   The server MUST store pk; it MUST NOT store seed.

6.1.2.  Registration

   The registration phase consists of one message sent from the client
   to the server.  This message contains the verifier, a public key, and
   32-byte salt.  The server stores this information corresponding to
   the client for future use in the verification flow.  This phase
   requires a secure channel from client to server in order to transfer
   the password verifier and public key.  The salt can be sent in plain
   text.

   We recommend that the salt is a random byte string: salt =
   random(32).  However, in practice this may require additional
   communication flows.  Instead, one may consider deriving the salt
   from some client-specific value that it knows locally.

   A high level flow overview of the registration flow is below.

   Client: PRS, salt                    Server: N/A
          ---------------------------------------
    (v, pk) = GenVerifiers(PRS, salt)
               |                           |
               |       salt, v, pk         |
               |-------------------------->|
               |                           |
               |                   Store (salt, v, pk)
               |                           |
          ---------------------------------------

6.2.  The Password Confirmation Stage

   In the password confirmation (PC) stage, the client proves knowledge
   of its password without revealing it.  It uses the registered
   verifiers from the previous subsection.  To do so securely, it uses
   the key established by CPaceQUAKE, which allows it to realize a
   confidential but unauthenticated channel.  In other words, this
   password confirmation stage cannot be used by itself.  This PC stage
   is parameterized by a KEM, KDF, KSF; see Section 7 for specific
   configurations.

   The password confirmation is a two-round challenge-response flow
   between the server and client.  In particular, the server challenges
   the client to prove knowledge of its password.  More precisely, it
   challenges the client to prove knowledge of a seed, derived from the
   password using a key stretching function.  Both client and server
   share a symmetric key as input.  Additionally, the server has the
   client's public key and salt stored from the previous registration
   flow.

   A high level overview of this flow is below.

   Client: SK, PRS, sid          Server: SK, salt, pk, sid
          ---------------------------------------
             ctx, challenge = PC-Challenge(SK, salt, pk, sid)
               |                           |
               |         challenge         |
               |<--------------------------|
               |                           |
     client_key, response = PC-Response(SK, seed, challenge, sid)
               |                           |
               |         response          |
               |-------------------------->|
               |                           |
                   server_key = PC-Verify(ctx, response)
               |                           |
          ---------------------------------------
     output client_key            output server_key

6.2.1.  Server Challenge

   To construct the challenge, the server encapsulates to the client's
   public key.  From the resulting shared secret, it then derives
   password confirmation values and a new shared secret.  The challenge
   message is the ciphertext encrypted using a one-time pad derived from
   the shared secret.  The password confirmation values are byte strings
   of length Nkc.

   The implementation MUST NOT reveal server_key from the context.

PC-Challenge

Input:
- SK, 32-byte symmetric key, a byte string
- transcript, the transcript from previously executed protocols to which this protocol is bound, a byte string
- pk, client-registered public key, a KEM public key
- sid, session identifier, a byte string
- U and S, client and server identifiers

Output:
- context, opaque state for the server to store values to complete the protocol
- challenge, an encoded protocol message for the server to send to the client

Parameters:
- KEM, a KEM instance
- KDF, a KDF instance
- DST, domain separation tag, a byte string

def PC-Challenge(SK, transcript, pk, sid, U, S):
  (c, k) = KEM.Encaps(pk)
  r = KDF.Expand(SK, DST || "OTP", Nct)
  enc_c = XOR(c, r)

  confirm_input = encode_sid(sid, U, S) || SK || enc_c || transcript

  prk_k_h1 = KDF.Extract(confirm_input, DST || "h1", nil)
  prk_k_h2 = KDF.Extract(confirm_input || k, DST || "h2", nil)

  // Derive h1 from the full transcript excluding k
  client_confirm = KDF.Expand(prk_k_h1, DST || "client_confirm", Nkc)

  // Derive h2 || SK from the full transcript including k
  server_confirm = KDF.Expand(prk_k_h2, DST || "server_confirm", Nkc)
  server_key = KDF.Expand(prk_k_h2, DST || "key", Nkey)

  challenge = (enc_c, client_confirm)

  return Context(server_confirm, server_key), challenge

6.2.2.  Client Response

   Upon receipt of the challenge, the client decrypts the value and
   recovers the salt, KEM ciphertext, and password confirmation value.
   It then uses the seed to re-derive the KEM key pair, using the same
   procedure followed during the registration flow.  The client then
   decapsulates the ciphertext to recover the shared secret and derive
   the same password confirmation values and new shared secret as the
   server.

   The client then checks that the server-provided confirmation value
   matches its own and aborts if not.  Otherwise, it returns its own
   password confirmation value.  The client outputs the new shared
   secret as its output.

PC-Response

Input:
- SK, 32-byte symmetric key, a byte string
- seed, seed used to derive KEM public key
- transcript, the transcript from previously executed protocols to which this protocol is bound, a byte string
- challenge, an encoded protocol message for the server to send to the client
- sid, session identifier, a byte string
- U and S, client and server identifiers

Output:
- client_key, a 32-byte string
- response, an encoded protocol message for the client to send to the server

Exceptions:
- AuthenticationError, raised when the password confirmation values do not match

Parameters:
- KEM, a KEM instance
- KDF, a KDF instance
- DST, domain separation tag, a byte string

def PC-Response(SK, seed, transcript, challenge, sid, U, S):
  (enc_c, client_confirm_target) = challenge
  r = KDF.Expand(SK, DST || "OTP", Nct)
  c = XOR(enc_c, r)

  (pk, sk) = KEM.DeriveKeyPair(seed)
  k = KEM.Decaps(sk, c)

  confirm_input = encode_sid(sid, U, S) || SK || enc_c || transcript

  prk_k_h1 = KDF.Extract(confirm_input, DST || "h1", nil)
  prk_k_h2 = KDF.Extract(confirm_input || k, DST || "h2", nil)

  // Derive h1 from the full transcript excluding k
  client_confirm = KDF.Expand(prk_k_h1, DST || "client_confirm", Nkc)

  // Derive h2 || SK from the full transcript including k
  server_confirm = KDF.Expand(prk_k_h2, DST || "server_confirm", Nkc)
  client_key = KDF.Expand(prk_k_h2, DST || "key", Nkey)

  if client_confirm != client_confirm_target:
    raise AuthenticationError

  return client_key, server_confirm

6.2.3.  Server Verify

   Upon receipt of the response, the server validates that the password
   confirmation value matches its own value.  If the value does not
   match, the server aborts.  Otherwise, the server outputs the new
   shared secret as its output.

PC-Verify

Input:
- context, opaque context produced by Challenge
- response, client's response message, a byte string

Output:
- server_key, a 32-byte string

Exceptions:
- AuthenticationError, raised when the password confirmation values do not match

Parameters:

def PC-Verify(Context(server_confirm, server_key), server_confirm_target):
  if server_confirm != server_confirm_target:
    raise AuthenticationError
  return server_key

6.3.  Composition of CPaceQUAKE & Password Confirmation

   The composition of CPaceQUAKE and the password confirmation stage is
   strictly sequential.  First, the parties run CPaceQUAKE using the
   verifier.  The client recovers this verifier using the
   GenVerifierMaterial function.  After that, the parties proceed with
   password confirmation, which is initiated by the server using the
   stored public key.  The client uses the seed that was also produced
   by GenVerifierMaterial to prove knowledge of the password.  This seed
   MUST remain secret to prevent impersonation.  An overview of the
   composition is below.

           +----------------------------------------------+

   Upon successful completion of the entire protocol, the client and
   server will share a symmetric key that was authenticated by knowledge
   of the password.  The protocol aborts if the password did not match.
   The protocol flows are shown below.  Note here that if the client
   does not know the salt, the server must send it, which it can do in
   plain text.

7.  CPaceQUAKE+ Configurations

   CPaceQUAKE+ is instantiated by selecting a configuration of a group
   and hash function for the CPace protocol, a KEM, KDF, KSF, for
   password confirmation, and a KEM and KDF for CPaceQUAKE, and a
   general purpose cryptographic hash function H.  The KEM, KDF, are not
   required to be the same, so they are distinguished by "PC-" and
   "PAKE-" prefixes, e.g., PC-KDF and PAKE-KDF are the KDFs for the
   password confirmation stage and the CPaceQUAKE protocol,
   respectively.

   The RECOMMENDED configuration is below.

   *  CPace-Group: ristretto255-SHA512

   *  CPace-Hash: SHA-512

   *  KEM: X-Wing [XWING]

   *  PC-KDF: HKDF-SHA-256

   *  PC-KSF: Argon2id(S = zeroes(16), p = 4, T = Nh, m = 2^21, t = 1, v
      = 0x13, K = nil, X = nil, y = 2) [ARGON2]

   *  BUKEM: ML-BUKEM768 Section 4.1

   *  PAKE-KDF: HKDF-SHA-256

   *  H: SHA256

   *  DST:
      "1b3abc3cd05e8054e8399bc38dfcbc1321d2e1b02da335ed1e8031ef5199f672"
      (a randomly generated 32-byte string)

   The RECOMMENDED parameters are (see Appendix A):

   *  Nseed = 32

   *  Nverifier = 32

   *  Nkc = 64

   *  Nsec = 32

   *  Nkey = 32, this is achieved by choosing H in CPace with
      H.b_in_bytes = 32

   Other documents can define configurations as needed for their use
   case, subject to the following requirements:

   1.  KEM MUST be a hybrid KEM, i.e., one that achieves both classical
       and post-quantum security.

   2.  The parameters must be chosen so they correspond with this KEM.
       E.g., Nseed must have the correct length.

8.  Implementation Considerations

   Some functions included in this specification are fallible (as noted
   by their ability to raise exceptions).  The explicit errors generated
   throughout this specification, along with conditions that lead to
   each error, are as follows:

   *  AuthenticationError: The PC protocol fails password confirmation
      checks at the client or server; Section 6.2

   Beyond these explicit errors, CPaceQUAKE+ implementations can produce
   implicit errors.  For example, if protocol messages sent between
   client and server do not match their expected size, an implementation
   should produce an error.

   The errors in this document are meant as a guide for implementors.
   They are not an exhaustive list of all the errors an implementation
   might emit.  For example, an implementation might run out of memory.

Appendix A.  Deriving parameters

   This section discusses how to generate parameters, given an upper
   bound on an adversary's advantage in breaking the hybrid (a)PAKE.
   The parameters in this standard correspond to a classical hardness of
   117 bits (considering the attacker can break CPace) and a quantum
   hardness of 100 bits.  We assume that an adversary can perform at
   most 2^qq queries to random oracles or (a)PAKE sessions.  We use qq =
   64.  The derivation below uses some approximations, ignoring small
   constants in the exponent such as 1 and 1.6.  We also only study
   dominant terms in the advantage equations.

A.1.  Parameters for CPaceQUAKE+

   We have the following requirements:

   *  Nseed * 8 + Nverifier * 8 >= 2 * qq + classical hardness

   *  Nverifier * 8 >= qq + classical hardness

   *  Nkc * 8 >= qq + classical hardness

   *  KEM failure <= -qq - classical hardness

   *  KEM ind vs classical <= -qq - classical hardness

   *  KEM ind vs quantum <= -qq - quantum hardness

   *  CPaceQUAKE vs classical <= classical hardness

   *  CPaceQUAKE vs quantum <= quantum hardness

   For ML-KEM we have Nseed = 32.  For consistency, the spec uses
   Nverifier = 32.  ML-KEM768's failure probability is 2^-165.2 and ML-
   KEM1024's failure probability is 2^-175.2.  Both are slightly too
   large, but we deem them acceptable: the chance that an adversary
   encounters a failure is purely statistical and very small.

   The following subsection discusses the parameters and hardness of
   CPaceQUAKE.

A.2.  Parameters for CPaceQUAKE

   For the security of CPaceQUAKE+, we require that CPaceQUAKE provides:

   *  CPaceQUAKE vs classical <= classical hardness

   *  CPaceQUAKE vs quantum <= quantum hardness

   We have the following requirements when CPaceQUAKE relies on CPace's
   security:

   *  CPace vs classical <= classical hardness

   *  Nkey * 8 >= qq + classical hardness

   *  KEM failure <= -qq - classical hardness

   We have the following requirements when CPaceQUAKE relies on QUAKE's
   security:

   *  QUAKE vs classical <= classical hardness

   *  QUAKE vs quantum <= quantum hardness

   *  Nkey * 8 >= 2*qq + classical hardness

   So, the smallest Nkey = 32.  We ignore the KEM failure following the
   same reasoning as above.

   The following subsections discuss the parameters and hardness of
   CPace and QUAKE.

A.3.  Parameters for CPace

   We refer to the CPace [CPace].  This standard requires Nkey, the
   number of bytes in CPace's session key, to be 32, so one must set
   H.bmax_in_bytes = 32.

A.4.  Parameters for QUAKE

   We have the following requirements:

   *  BUKEM ind vs classical <= -qq - classical hardness

   *  BUKEM ind vs quantum <= -qq - quantum hardness

   *  BUKEM public key uniformity vs classical <= -qq - classical
      hardness

   *  BUKEM public key uniformity vs quantum <= -qq - quantum hardness

   *  BUKEM ciphertext uniformity vs classical <= -qq - classical
      hardness

   *  BUKEM ciphertext uniformity vs quantum <= -qq - quantum hardness

   *  BUKEM key * 8 >= qq + classical hardness

   *  KEM failure <= -qq - classical hardness

   For, ML-BUKEM it is as hard or harder to break public key and
   ciphertext uniformity as it is to break indistinguishability, so we
   discuss all three properties at once.

   For ML-BUKEM768, the resistance to classical attacks is approximately
   181 - qq bits of security.  So for qq = 64, classical hardness is
   approximately 117 bits of security.  The resistance to quantum
   attacks is approximately 164 - qq bits of security.  So for qq = 64,
   quantum hardness is approximately 100 bits of security.

   For ML-BUKEM1024, this would come out to 253 - 64 = 189 bits of
   security for classical attacks and 230 - 64 = 166 bits of security
   for quantum attacks.

   The ML-BUKEM key is 32 bytes, so this satisfies the requirements.  We
   ignore the KEM failure following the same reasoning as above.
